	abstract = {Reducing motorized travel and increased active travel are top priorities for many communities. However, these goals are challenged by pressures that make governments reluctant to re/invest in public services, including schools. Public school boards are increasingly asked to do more with less, a directive often accomplished by closing and consolidating schools. Such policies can reduce the proximity of schools for many students, thereby limiting opportunities for active travel. In this paper, we examine the City of Hamilton, a mid-sized city in Ontario, Canada, which saw numerous elementary schools closures between 2011 and 2021. Our analysis evaluates how school closures and consolidations reshaped school-seat accessibility (the potential to spatially interact) for elementary school students, both by motorized and active travel. We use spatial availability, a singly-constrained multimodal measure of spatial accessibility. This method’s proportional allocation mechanisms allows for consistent comparisons in accessibility between time periods. The analysis is conducted at the parcel level, taking into account the on-the-ground-capacity ({OTGC}) of schools and observed home-to-school trip lengths for motorized and active modes. Overall, our findings reveal a decline in school spatial availability in the city. While the school closure and consolidation policy pursued by the province may have achieved cost savings in facility operation and maintenance, it imposed ongoing costs on students, families, and communities through reduced opportunities for physical activity and entrenched reliance on motorized travel.},

As the urgency to respond to climate change increases and the transport sector disproportionally increases its contributions to global {GHG} emissions, there is a need for a more meaningful and transparent application of tools to cost {GHG} emission reduction. This study presents a multi-objective integer optimization ({MIO}) model to support the costing and {GHG} reduction estimation of electric mobility road passenger transportation policies. The model considers both cost and {GHG} emission minimization under resource constraints and background changes in policy interventions within interval ranges for the province of Ontario’s (Canada) in year 2030. All Pareto optimal solutions are included but results that indicate the optimal policy allocation for two discrete targets are discussed in detail; one scenario where \$3 billion spending over ten years is the target and another scenario where the target is 40\% {GHG} reduction in year 2030 (relative to 2005 levels). The {MIO} approach offers an out-of-the-box solution to support the {GHG}-reducing decision-making process at all levels of government by implementing optimal policy combinations to achieve {GHG} emission reductions under a target {GHG} emission reduction target and/or budget.},

	abstract = {Floating Catchment Area ({FCA}) methods are a popular tool to investigate accessibility to public facilities, in particular health care services. {FCA} approaches are attractive because, unlike other accessibility measures, they take into account the potential for congestion of facilities. This is done by 1) considering the population within the catchment area of a facility to calculate a variable that measures level of service, and then 2) aggregating the level of service by population centers subject to catchment area constraints. In this paper we discuss an effect of {FCA} approaches, an artifact that we term demand and level of service inflation. These artifacts are present in previous implementations of {FCA} methods. We argue that inflation makes interpretation of estimates of accessibility difficult, which has possible deleterious consequences for decision making. Next, we propose a simple and intuitive approach to proportionally allocate demandand and level of service in {FCA} calculations. The approach is based on a standardization of the impedance matrix, similar to approaches popular in the spatial statistics and econometrics literature. The result is a more intiuitive measure of accessibility that 1) provides a local version of the provider-to-population ratio; and 2) preserves the level of demand and the level of supply in a system. We illustrate the relevant issues with some examples, and then empirically by means of a case study of accessibility to family physicians in the Hamilton Census Metropolitan Area ({CMA}), in Ontario, Canada. Results indicate that demand and supply inflation/deflation affect the interpretation of accessibility analysis using existing {FCA} methods, and that the proposed adjustment can lead to more intuitive results.},

	abstract = {Place-based accessibility measures communicate the potential interaction with opportunities at a zone that populations can access. Recent research has explored the implications of how opportunities are counted by different accessibility methods. In conventional measures, opportunities are multiply counted if more than one zone offers access to the same opportunity. This multi-count of opportunities leads to values of accessibility that are difficult to interpret. A possible solution to enhance the meaning-making of accessibility results is by constraining the calculations to match a known quantity. This ensures all zonal values sum up to a predetermined quantity (i.e., the total number of opportunities). In this way, each value can be meaningfully related to this total. A recent effort that implements this solution is spatial availability, a singly-constrained accessibility measure. In this paper, we extend spatial availability for use in the case of multiple modes or more generally, heterogeneous population segments with distinct travel behaviors. After deriving a multimodal version of spatial availability, we proceed to illustrate its features using a synthetic example. We then apply it to an empirical example of low emission zones in Madrid, Spain. We conclude with suggestions for future research and its use in evaluating policy interventions.},

	shorttitle = {Accessibility to health care facilities in Montreal Island},
	abstract = {Background: Geographical access to health care facilities is known to influence health services usage. As societies age, accessibility to health care becomes an increasingly acute public health concern. It is known that seniors tend to have lower mobility levels, and it is possible that this may negatively affect their ability to reach facilities and services. Therefore, it becomes important to examine the mobility situation of seniors vis-a-vis the spatial distribution of health care facilities, to identify areas where accessibility is low and interventions may be required.
Methods: Accessibility is implemented using a cumulative opportunities measure. Instead of assuming a fixed bandwidth (i.e. a distance threshold) for measuring accessibility, in this paper the bandwidth is defined using model-based estimates of average trip length. Average trip length is an all-purpose indicator of individual mobility and geographical reach. Adoption of a spatial modelling approach allows us to tailor these estimates of travel behaviour to specific locations and person profiles. Replacing a fixed bandwidth with these estimates permits us to calculate customized location- and person-based accessibility measures that allow inter-personal as well as geographical comparisons. Data: The case study is Montreal Island. Geo-coded travel behaviour data, specifically average trip length, and relevant traveller’s attributes are obtained from the Montreal Household Travel Survey. These data are complemented with information from the Census. Health care facilities, also geo-coded, are extracted from a comprehensive business point database. Health care facilities are selected based on Standard Industrial Classification codes 8011-21 (Medical Doctors and Dentists).
Results: Model-based estimates of average trip length show that travel behaviour varies widely across space. With the exception of seniors in the downtown area, older residents of Montreal Island tend to be significantly less mobile than people of other age cohorts. The combination of average trip length estimates with the spatial distribution of health care facilities indicates that despite being more mobile, suburban residents tend to have lower levels of accessibility compared to central city residents. The effect is more marked for seniors. Furthermore, the results indicate that accessibility calculated using a fixed bandwidth would produce patterns of exposure to health care facilities that would be difficult to achieve for suburban seniors given actual mobility patterns.
Conclusions: The analysis shows large disparities in accessibility between seniors and non-seniors, between urban and suburban seniors, and between vehicle owning and non-owning seniors. This research was concerned with potential accessibility levels. Follow up research could consider the results reported here to select case studies of actual access and usage of health care facilities, and related health outcomes.},

In response, we designed a methodology that uses the concepts of accessibility and affordability as a complementary means for evaluating public transport investment, and identifying transport disadvantages and priorities for project generation.

	abstract = {Social equity is increasingly incorporated as a long-term objective into urban transportation plans. Researchers use accessibility measures to assess equity issues, such as determining the amount of jobs reachable by marginalized groups within a deﬁned travel time threshold and compare these measures across socioeconomic categories. However, allocating public transit resources in an equitable manner is not only related to travel time, but also related to the out-of-pocket cost of transit, which can represent a major barrier to accessibility for many disadvantaged groups. Therefore, this research proposes a set of new accessibility measures that incorporates both travel time and transit fares. It then applies those measures to determine whether people residing in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods in Montreal, Canada experience the same levels of transit accessibility as those living in other neighborhoods. Results are presented in terms of regional accessibility and trends by social indicator decile. Travel time accessibility measures estimate a higher number of jobs that can be reached compared to combined travel time and cost measures. However, the degree and impact of these measures varies across the social deciles. Compared to other groups in the region, residents of socially disadvantaged areas have more equitable accessibility to jobs using transit; this is reﬂected in smaller decreases in accessibility when fare costs are included. Generating new measures of accessibility combining travel time and transit fares provides more accurate measures that can be easily communicated by transportation planners and engineers to policy makers and the public since it translates accessibility measures to a dollar value.},

	abstract = {Accessibility is a concept of continuing relevance in transportation research. A number of different measures of accessibility, deﬁned as the potential to reach spatially dispersed opportunities, have been proposed in the literature, and used to address various substantive planning and policy questions. Our objective in this paper is to conduct a review of various commonly used measures of accessibility, with a particular view to clarifying their normative (i.e. prescriptive), as well as positive (i.e. descriptive) aspects. This is a distinction that has seldom been made in the literature and that helps to better understand the meaning of alternative ways to implement the concept of accessibility. Our discussion of the positive and normative aspects of accessibility measurements is illustrated using the city of Montreal, Canada, as a case study. The example highlights the differences in the measured levels of accessibility depending on implementation. Comparison of the two by means of a relative indicator of accessibility helps to identify the gap between desired (as normative deﬁned) and actual (as revealed) accessibility levels.},
