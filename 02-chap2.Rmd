THIS CHAPTER IS the second half of _"Family of accessibility measures derived from spatial interaction principles"_ , & the multimodal extension of the family, considering different groups of travel behaviour. 


## Total Constrained Multimodally Accessibile Opportunities and Population

This measure can also be extended to reflect multiple modes. In this analysis, four modes are considered: the motorized car and transit options, and the non-motorized cycling and walking options. From origins to destinations, each mode has a different travel impedance function $f^m(\cdot)$ and travel time cost $c^m_{ij}$ (note: $c^m_{ij}$ and $c^m_{ji}$ are assumed to be equal). The totally-constrained formula is modified as follows include a sub-index $m$: 

$$
V^{mT}_{ij} = K^{mT} \cdot W_j^{(2)} \cdot f^m(c^m_{ij})
$${#eq-total-constrained-multimodal-access}

Where:
- $V^{mT}_{ij}$ is the number of opportunities that can be accessed at origin zone $i$ from destination zone $j$ by mode $m$, 
- $f^m(c^m_{ij})$ is the cost of travel $c^m_{ij}$ by mode $m$ from $i$ to $j$, 
- the destination zone attraction mass $W_j^{(2)}$ is the number of opportunities (i.e., the parkland in hectares at a park $j$), and 
- $K^{mT}$ is the modal total constraint $\frac{D}{\sum_m\sum_i\sum_j W^{(2)}_jf^m(c^m_{ij})}$ that serves to proportionally allocate the opportunities $D$ in the region and ensures units remain balanced.

Summarising equation \ref{eq:total-constrained-multimodal-access} as a measure of modal totally-constrained accessibility $V^{mT}_i$ by summing all $V^{mT}_{ij}$ for a specific $i$ and $m$ (i.e., $V^{mT}_i = \sum_j V^{mT}_{ij}$). $V^{mT}_i$ can also be summed by mode to equal $V^{T}_i$ (i.e., $\sum_m V^{mT}_i = V^{T}_i$) and summed across the region to equal $D$ (i.e., $\sum_m\sum_i\sum_j V^{mT}_{ij} = \sum_m\sum_i V^{mT}_{i} = D$).

Transposing $i$ and $j$ and expressing $M^{mT}_{ji}$, the multimodal 'market potential' or the population accessible by mode can also be defined using the totally-constrained formulation, with similar parameters as previously defined.
$$
M^{mT}_{ji} = \hat K^{mT} \cdot W_i^{(1)} f^m(c^m_{ji})
