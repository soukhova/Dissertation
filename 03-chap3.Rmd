## Overview

Urban greenspace has many benefits for residents and the environment: it is linked to wellbeing [], higher rates of physical activity [], and contributes to reducing urban island heating as well as mitigating carbon pollution in combating climate change []. Parkland, or greenspace that is owned and operated by a locality, can also be framed as a public service. In this way, the spatial accessibility to parkland should be concerned with ensuring it is distributed in an equitable way. 

In this chapter, the empirical example of parkland city of Toronto will be detailed, including (1) the spatial resolution of the zoning system and the residing population, (2) the assumptions associated with calculating parkland entrance points, and the (3) assumed interaction with parkland. (4) Following the data, the totally-constrained accessibility measure is briefly summarised. The calculated results are presented and interpreted in a policy-relevant lens: namely, the amount of parkland that is accessible per zone, identification of zones with low and high accessibility.

Notably, this process of methods, data and results presentation was done in consultation with staff from the City of Toronto. They are actively working on developing the Transportation Equity Policy Framework and are partners of the Mobilizing Justice Partnership. All data is openly available, but is edited by the city staff (as attributed) or using assumptions the city staff were agreement with.

## Data

### Origins: the dissemination block and associated census data

The most disaggregated level that census variables (e.g., household income, proportion commute mode) is available is the level of the dissemination area (DA). Census zoning systems are designed by Statistics Canada to represent the population's socioeconomic characteristics as homogeneously, with disaggregated systems (like the DA) requiring to nest within more aggregated systems while remaining a relatively compact geographic size [@statcan_DAdef_2021]. Each DA in the Toronto metropolitan area represents population between `r TO_census_21_DA$Population |> quantile(0.25) |> as.numeric()` (Q1) to `r TO_census_21_DA$Population |> quantile(0.75) |> as.numeric()`(Q3)) and each representing between `r as.numeric(quantile(TO_census_21_DA[[1]], 0.25))` sq km (Q1) to `r as.numeric(quantile(TO_census_21_DA[[1]], 0.75))` sq km (Q3)) in area.

However, population data is available at an even more disaggregated level, the dissemination blocks (DB). The DB is an artifact of the road network [@statcan_DBdef_2021], with between 2 to 5 DBs being typically nested within one DA <!-- `r TO_census_21_DB |> st_drop_geometry() |> group_by(DA_UID) |> summarise(count = n()) |> pull(count) |> summary()`-->. The more accurately the origin point represents the known residing population, the more accurately the routed travel time and hence the accessibility results along with its associated assumptions, can be understood. Moreover, the highest level of spatial disaggregation available, is typically the preferred appropriate: to reduce issues associated with the scale effect of the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) []. 

For these reasons, points that are representative of the population within each DB was calculated using the methodology described by Statistics Canada [@statcan_reppoint_2021]. These representative points are available through Statistics Canada at the DA level, however, DB level points are not. hence, the calculated DB points, or the DB weighted centroids, were generated by the staff at the City of Toronto, and sent to the author on May 2, 2025. The methodology to prepare the points is summarised as follows: (1) if the DB contained no address points, then the geometric centroid of the DB was used, (2) if the DB contains 1 or more address points, then the central point between the dwelling weighted address points was calculated. If this point was not with the DB boundaries, it was manually moved into the DB.

To contextualise the Toronto metropolitan area, the population (per DB) and the associated DA boundaries plus the cities that compose the Toronto metropolitan area are visualised in Figure \ref{fig:chp3-toronto_CMA_plot}.
 
```{r ,fig.align='center', out.width="6in", fig.cap="\\label{fig:chp3-toronto_CMA_plot}Map of Toronto CMA with population per DB from the 2021 Census"}

```

To contextualise the city of Toronto, the focus of this analysis, Figure \ref{fig:chp3-toronto_popden_NIAs_plot} demonstrates the 158 neighbourhoods in Toronto according to improvement classification: either a "Neighbourhood Improvement Area" (NIA), "Emerging Neighbourhood" (EA), or neither, based on an analysis conducted by the City. The methodology was based on the development of a composite indicator including dimensions of relative marginalization of the population who resides in these neighbourhood and of the neighbourhood infrastructure itself, such as variables reflecting economic opportunities (e.g., unemployment), social development (e.g., highschool graduation), participation in decision-making (e.g., voting), neighbourhood infrastructure (e.g., walkability, community places for meetings), and health (e.g., premature mortality) [@toronto_neighbourhoods2024; @toronto_NEI_2014]. Overall, higher-population neighbourhoods are concentrated near the lake in the downtown core. Most NIAs are located in the east and northwest of the city and tend to have lower population densities, though two high-density NIAs are located in downtown.

And lastly, the Figure \ref{fig:chp3-toronto_popden_DBCent_plot} displays the calculated DB weighted centroids, used as the origins in the accessibility analysis. There are `r DB_Centroids |> nrow()` points within the City, more spatially clustered in areas with higher population density.

### Toronto parkland destinations and normative travel behaviour

Parkland is defined as city operated and/or owned 'parks' identified in the greenspaces shapefile available through the city's official Open Data portal [@toronto_greenspaces2025]. These are the same park assets that are identified as part of the Parkland Strategy report commissioned by the City of Toronto [@toronto_parkland2019 p.20]. This report serves as a guideline for assumptions made regarding park classification and interaction catchments based on park classification. Toronto's parkland is visualized in Figure \ref{fig:chp3-parkland_paths_plot}. Of note, other Open Spaces include in the greenspaces shapefile are federally or provincially owned/operated spaces, school yards, cemeteries, and hydro corridors. These spaces are not assumed to be Toronto operated and/or owned parkland, hence are not included in this analysis. These greenspaces are reflected as 'no population' DBs.

```{r ,fig.align='center', out.width="6in", fig.cap="\\label{fig:chp3-parkland_paths_plot}Map of the City of Toronto's Parkland (with paths or no paths) atop the population density from the 2021 Census"} 
knitr::include_graphics("./data/figures/chp3-parkland_paths_plot.png")
```

As retrieved from @toronto_parkland2019 [pg.15], the parkland can be categorized by size: 'Parkette' (<0.5 ha) (`r ((parkland_grouped |> filter(park_size == "Parkette") |> nrow())/nrow(parkland_grouped)) |> scales::percent()` of all parks), 'Small Park' (0.5–1.5 ha) (`r ((parkland_grouped |> filter(park_size == "Small Park") |> nrow())/nrow(parkland_grouped)) |> scales::percent()`), 'Medium Park' (1.5–3.0 ha) `r ((parkland_grouped |> filter(park_size == "Medium Park") |> nrow())/nrow(parkland_grouped)) |> scales::percent()`, 'Large Park' (3.0–5.0 ha) `r ((parkland_grouped |> filter(park_size == "Large Park") |> nrow())/nrow(parkland_grouped)) |> scales::percent()`, 'City Park' (5.0–8.0 ha) `r ((parkland_grouped |> filter(park_size == "City Park") |> nrow())/nrow(parkland_grouped)) |> scales::percent()`, and 'Legacy Park' (>8.0 ha) `r ((parkland_grouped |> filter(park_size == "Legacy Park") |> nrow())/nrow(parkland_grouped)) |> scales::percent()`. Interaction with parks can be assumed in a variety of ways, but in this analysis, it is normatively [@paez2012measuring] defined based on the park classification catchments described in @toronto_parkland2019 as well as assumptions associated with the mode: as outlined in the following section.

How parks can potentially be accessed is assumed based on their entrances. Entrances are not explicitly available, so they are assumed. They are calculated based on the parkland edge intersection with each path within the park itself or intersecting the park edge. `r parkland_grouped |> filter(is.na(count_entrances_P_ID)) |>  unique() |> length()` of the the `r nrow(parkland_grouped)` parks have paths, each with anywhere between `r parkland_edge_and_centroid_entrance_points_groupedbypark$count_of_entrance |> min()` to `r parkland_edge_and_centroid_entrance_points_groupedbypark$count_of_entrance |> max()` (median of `r parkland_edge_and_centroid_entrance_points_groupedbypark$count_of_entrance |> median()`) entrances. The remaining  `r nrow(parkland_grouped)- (parkland_grouped |> filter(is.na(count_entrances_P_ID)) |>  unique() |> length())` parks do not have paths, and hence their entrances cannot be precisely assumed. Parks without an entrance are significantly smaller in area (i.e., median of `r parkland_grouped |> filter(is.na(count_entrances_P_ID)) |> pull(area_ha) |> median() |> round(2)` ha as opposed to the median of area parks with paths which is `r parkland_grouped |> filter(!is.na(count_entrances_P_ID)) |> pull(area_ha) |> median() |> round(2)` ha). Upon visual inspection using Google Maps streetview, parks with no paths often contain a playground, some sport amenity or gardens within the center. Some of them are unfurnished -containing only mowed grass. For these parks with no internal paths, it is assumed then that these spaces can be entered from any direction and that the geometry centroid is the point of interest  calculated and assumed as the entrance point. This point is snapped onto the transportation network based on an origin's shortest path, as will be later described in the routing subsection. 

As a visualisation, Figure \ref{fig:chp3-park_entrance_example_plot} contains a panel of three DAs in Toronto, each displaying the roads, parks, and assumed park entrances. Readers should note that in the first two panels, these parks contain multiple entrance points, corresponding to where the edge of the paths within the parks intersect with the edge of the park boundary. These plots showcase different DAs that represent the diversity in DA size and park composition across the city. The first plot showcases a relatively small DA, near the downtown core of the city featuring high density of population, other amenities and multimodal transportation systems. This DA is unique in the area, as it features a large planned 'Legacy' park by the name of Christie Pits. Planned parks are typically square or rectangular and can be accessed from most of the sides. They are also contained within the city in all areal sizes. The second plot contains a larger DA, north of downtown, that contains a few parks and near higher density suburban built form. One is the Roycroft Park Lands, a large 'City' (smaller than Legacy), part of the Don River wetlands with maintained trails, enjoyed as nature reserve. Note it's long shape and minimal entrances. Natural parklands like Roycroft Park Lands are common along wetlands and other preserved natural spaces; they are typically larger in size (Medium, Large, or City parks) hence offer a lot of parkland space to those near their entrances. In the third plot, the DA is also large but with lower density suburban built form, and mostly residential. It contains only one small park: Pleasantview Park. This park contains no internal pathways, a playground in the middle of the park with no other amenities.

### Multimodal origin to destination routing and trip lengths

Routing of travel times was done using the travel_time_matrix() function in {r5r}, an R package that provides an R-interface for the Java-based R5 Routing engine [@pereiraR5rRapidRealistic2021]. The function was run four time, one for bicycle, car, transit and walking modes, producing four separate travel time matrices. Each origin destination pair has an associated shortest travel time, selected by the function based on all possible origin destination routes given the input road network (and transit schedule, for the transit mode). The road network is an edited version of OpenStreetMaps (OSM) street network (December 9, 2022) and edited General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) files (February 4, 2024) for transit operating within the City i.e., GO (regional commuter train and bus service), TTC (local subway, lightrail, and bus network), and the UP Express (regional commuter train line). The files were edited by city staff to more accurately reflect access into TTC subway stations and reflect the transit schedule for the week of February 4 2025. 

Concerning the inputs for the 'travel_time_matrix()' function for all modal travel time calculations: the origins are the DB weighted centroids (`r DB_Centroids |> nrow()` locations), the destinations are points representing the `r parkland_grouped |> nrow()` parks and the OSM road network were used. Some parks have multiple pieces, separated by the road network: in total, there are `r parkland |> nrow()` park pieces, each with between `r parkland$count_entrances_P_piece_ID |> min(na.rm=TRUE)` and `r parkland$count_entrances_P_piece_ID |> max(na.rm=TRUE)` path entrances (median `r parkland$count_entrances_P_piece_ID |> median(na.rm=TRUE)` entrances) or 1 park piece centroid. In total, there are `r parkland_edge_and_centroid_entrance_points |> nrow()` possible destination points (`r parkland_edge_and_centroid_entrance_points |> st_drop_geometry() |> filter(entrance_type == "Edge intersection")  |> nrow()` path entrances and  `r parkland_edge_and_centroid_entrance_points |> st_drop_geometry() |> filter(entrance_type != "Edge intersection")  |> nrow()` centroids) for each of the `r DB_Centroids |> nrow()` origins. 

For the motorized modes, a maximum travel time of 120 minutes was selected. For transit, the GTFS files and a departure time of between 11:00-11:15am (i.e., a 15 minute departure window) on February 8th 2025 was used, to reflect a Saturday afternoon transit schedule. Travel speeds reflect the posted speeds and intersections as gleaned from the OSM road network, and for transit, the scheduled transit arrival times at stops according to the GTFS file. For non-motorized modes, a maximum travel time of 30 minutes was selected, and the default travel speeds of 3.6 km/h for walk and 12 km/h for cycling was assumed. The travel time thresholds of 120 minutes and 30 minutes was set to normatively reflect the likelihood to travel to parks, by mode.

<!-- numbers from 03-selecting-tts.qmd, would take about ~30min to run...--> It is worthwhile summarising the multimodal travel time matrices. Notably, within a 120 minutes trip by motorized modes, the majority of DBs can reach all parks by car (with exception to the 6 on the Toronto Islands, inaccessible by car), i.e., the median DB can reach 1601 out of the 1607 parks, while the most isolated can still reach 184 parks. By contrast, within a 120 minute trip or less by transit, a median DB can only reach 1116 parks, with the most central DB reaching 1539 parks meaning 4% of parks are feasibly unreachable by transit for DBs in the City of Toronto. These parks are located at the edges of the city in that are transit poor, as will be demonstrated and discussed in the findings. Comparing this reach to the lower range non-motorized modes, the number of parks reachable by foot or by cycle within 30 minutes from a DB is much lower: a median DB can only reach 15 parks (max. 61 parks for the most central DB) by walking and 86 parks (max. 295 parks for the most central DB) by cycling.

As a final note on routing assumptions, it's useful to compare travel times to park centroids versus park path entrances. For the 1204 parks with known path entrances, centroids were also computed and travel times from all DBs to all centroids were calculated. This comparison highlights the impact of the R5 routing algorithm, namely, how the routed travel times can differ depending on how the destination points are ‘snapped’ to the nearest road segment. If a point is not already on the road network, R5 snaps it to the nearest network segment, adding a walking time penalty based on distance. This snapping algorithm prioritizes minimizing overall travel time from the origin. Since edge entrances are typically already on the network, their snapping penalty is minimal. In contrast, centroid points--especially in large and irregular natural parks—may snap to parts of the road network that are unreachable by certain roads (e.g., far enough away from bus stops, or bike lanes), inflating travel times. Hence: when paths within the parks are available from the OSM network, they are used, as it more accurately reflects the points at each the parks can actually be entered from. But when the park has no entrances, it is assumed that the centroid (or the middle of the park itself) is the destination point, and the associated snapping penalty is folded into the calculated travel time. The following Figure \ref{fig:chp3-ent_vs_cent_tt_car_transit_scatter} and Figure \ref{fig:chp3-ent_vs_cent_tt_cycle_walk_scatter} demonstrate the relationship between the minimum travel time used in the analysis for each parks with path entrances and the travel time if its centroid point was used, along with a 45 degree dashed line representing a perfect linear relationship.

Regarding the motorized modes in Figure \ref{fig:chp3-ent_vs_cent_tt_car_transit_scatter}), the relationship appears to be roughly, with centroid times being consistently lower than path entrance times--except for a few parks that fall to the left of the dashed line. Parks with entrance times that are larger than their centroid times have entrances that are not in opportune positions on the network relative to the snapped centroid point, and vice versa for entrances that have _lower_ travel times than their centroid points which is often the case. Transit shows a similar trend but with more noise. A few parks exhibit exceptionally high transit times relative to their centroid times. These are typically larger parks where the centroid snaps to a location near access points to the transit system, but the _actual_ path entrances are not in proximity to those opportune system access point. Since the road network for cars is more continuous and the system is more evenly accessible (e.g., the majority of roads can be driven on, whereas the transit system can only be entered in specific points), this discrepancy is not observed in the car mode. This comparison underscores the importance of using realistic entrance points especially for larger parks with few entrance points and for modes like transit, which do not provide uniform access into the system.

"} 
knitr::include_graphics("./data/figures/chp3-ent_vs_cent_tt_transit_car_scatter.png")
```

Figure \ref{fig:chp3-ent_vs_cent_tt_cycle_walk_scatter} captures the non-motorized modes, which exemplifies a similar pattern as the motorized modes, with centroid travel times beign typically longer than path entrance points in a linear relationship. However, like transit and car, travel by bike and walk demonstrate different levels of noise. As the travel time threshold is 30 minutes, distance can be traversed at a faster rate by bike than by foot, hence differences in distances between the path entrance point and the snapped centroid is less impact on the estimated travel time for bike mode.

#### Normative and empirical lengths of park-bound trips
A key component of accessibility is how the cost of overcoming spatial separation to reach a destination is considered. As normative goals for planning modal parkland provision have not be explicitly created, example normative trip lengths are defined. This definition is based on discussions with city staff and using distance catchments based on park size classifications from the @toronto_parkland2019 report. 

It is assumed that the smaller parks, i.e., parkette (<0.5ha), small parks (0.5-1.0 ha), and medium parks (1.5-3 ha) offer a service coverage of only 0.5km, 1.0km and 1.5km, respectively. Meaning, people are only likely to interact with the park within this travel distance. This assumption has to do with the qualities these parks possess, and the availability of similar parks in the area: namely, these smaller parks are often located in residential neighbourhoods, evenly spatially distributed, and often offer no exceptional amenity that can't be substituted by another similarly sized park nearby as inferred from @toronto_parkland2019. For larger parks, such as large parks (3-5 ha), city parks, and legacy parks, their service catchments are larger as they are more unique, attractive, and harder to substitute parks, as inferred from the @toronto_parkland2019 report. Large parks are assumed a service coverage of 3km and city and legacy parks are assumed to be attractive, and hence cover, the whole city.

```{r}
# Define the decay function
decay_func <- function(c) exp(-0.04 * c)
total_area <- integrate(decay_func, lower = 0, upper = 120)$value

# Cumulative distribution function (CDF)
cdf <- function(x) {
  integrate(decay_func, lower = 0, upper = x)$value / total_area
}

uniroot(function(x) cdf(x) - 0.5, lower = 0, upper = 120)$root
```

Hence normative trip lengths are assumed to vary based on park classification from @toronto_parkland2019, by travel mode and for the sake of communicability as inspired by discussions with city staff. In other words, the following normative travel impedance functions are set based on trip lengths that are _seen_ as acceptable and easy to explain. It is assumed that (1) non-motorized travelers are assumed not to travel over 15 minutes to any park, this includes all walking and cycling. For reference, this 0.5 km travel distance (i.e., the 'catchment' of parkettes) approximately translates to 8 mins of walking or 3 mins of cycling based on median routed travel speed. (2) transit users can access all types of parks, but based on a negative exponential distance decay function ($f(c_{ij}) = e^{-0.02c_{ij}}$). This function has a median travel time of approximately 30 minutes, meaning that half of the total weight of the travel impedance function--representing the spatial separation between people and parks--comes from trips between 0 to 30 minutes, and the other half comes from trips between 30 to 120 minutes. The function captures the idea that the deterrent effect of distance increases gradually, assigning progressively less 'spatial interaction' weight to more distant parks, even though they remain reachable. (3) Car users are assumed _not_ to travel to smaller parks (i.e., Parkette, small and medium parks) at all, and as such, these parks are excluded from accessibiltiy results for the car mode. For larger parks (i.e., large, city and legacy parks), car travel impedance is assumed also based on a negative exponential distance decay function, but with parameter $-0.04$ ($f(c_{ij}) = e^{-0.04c_{ij}}$), twice as steep as the transit impedance function. This reflects a  stronger deterrent effect with increasing travel time. Namely, with a median travel time of approximately 17 minutes, trips that are between 0 to 17 minutes are assigned half the weight of the travel impedance function and the remaining half is defused across trips that are between 17 minutes to 60 minutes. Destinations 60 minutes are considered effectively unreachable, with the function modeled as 0 beyond this point. 

These assumptions on interaction with parks and trip lengths by mode have equity implications: 
- Smaller parks are assumed to only be attractive to, hence accessible for, non-motorized and transit users
- For larger parks which can be reached by all modes, car mode has the largest range and has a steep decay, meaning it may provide favourable spatial separation weight, relative to other modes.
- Travel impedance for transit users is penalized more gradually, assuming broader reach to all park types
- Non-motorized users reach is constrained practically: they are assumed not to travel beyond 15 minutes
- For parks in less densely populated areas, i.e., with travel times by sustainable modes beyond 15 minutes, accessibility will only be present for car users. In sum, individuals in these areas who do not have access to a vehicle are effectively excluded.

These assumptions on interaction with parks and trip lengths by mode have equity implications:
- Smaller parks are assumed to be attractive only to non-motorized and transit users, and are therefore not included in the accessibility profile for car users.
- For larger parks, which are accessible by all modes, the car mode has the broadest assumed range and steepest decay, potentially resulting in more opportune spatial separation weighting relative to other modes.
- Transit users face a more gradual decay in travel impedance, reflecting broader assumed reach across all park types.
- Non-motorized users are assumed to be practically constrained in their reach, with travel limited to within 15 minutes on foot or by bike.
- Parks in lower-density areas requiring more than 15 minutes of travel by sustainable modes will contribute to high accessibility for car users exclusively. Individuals in these areas without access to a private vehicle are, effectively, excluded, and these zones will reflect very low levels of accessibility by sustainable modes.

\end{table}

To reiterate, the trip length based travel time behaviour summarised in Table \ref{tab:chp3-travel-impedance-by-park-mode} are _normative_--they represent a statement about what should be considered a reasonable travel time that defines parkland accessibility [@paez2012measuring]. In practice, however, travel behaviour empirically may diverge from these normative statements. For example, empirical data from the 2023 Transportation Tomorrow Survey of trips made for 'leisure' purposes by different modes in the Greater Toronto Area region, reveals different patterns [@data_management_group_tts_2023]. Figure \ref{fig:chp3-norm_pos_impedance_mode_parktype_plot} compares this normative travel behaviour (green lines) from Table \ref{tab:chp3-travel-impedance-by-park-mode} with the TTS empirically derived curves (dashed lines). For this analysis, the normative curves (i.e., Table \ref{tab:chp3-travel-impedance-by-park-mode}) are used to define accessibility. This will enable the interpretation of results in terms of what _should_ be accessible via each mode, according to planning goals, rather than what currently is based on observed travel behaviour.

#### Modal trip proportions

In the multimodal extension, the proportion of trips from each DB is also assumed to be a certain modal proportion. This too is taken from the 2022 TTS for leisure trips; a sample that includes 232,555 leisure trips made in Toronto by mode grouped as either transit, walking, cycling or car is used. All DBs (the most granular level of origin zone used in this work) are matched to the zoning system of the TTS (i.e., the Traffic Analysis Zone), and the modal splits of trips are retained and used to reflect the transit-using, car-using, walking and cycling mode population at that DB. Not all DBs fall in TAZs with trip data, so for those DBs, average for the dissementation area (containing a few DBs) was taken. For the few DBs in which dissemenations areas still did not contain any liesure trips, the census tract averages (containing a few DAs) were taken. In this way, all DBs now have a proportion of mode share assumed for liesure trips shown in Figure \ref{fig:chp3-mode_split_eachDB_plots.png}.

In the multimodal extension, the proportion of leisure trips from each DB is assigned based on modal split information. This information is derived from the 2022 Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS), which includes a sample of 232,555 trips made to leisure destination in the city of Toronto. Trips were grouped by mode as either: transit, walking, cycling, or car. Each DB--the most granular origin zone used in this analysis--was spatially linked to the TTS zoning system (i.e., Traffic Analysis Zones, or TAZs), and inherits the modal split of the TAZ it intersects. However, not all DBs fall within TAZs containing leisure trip data. In such cases (131 of the 13322 DBs), the average modal proportions for the parent Dissemination Area, which contains several DBs, were used. If no leisure trips are captured even at the DA level, the average for the next larger aggregation zone, the Census Tract, was used. Through this approach, all DBs are assigned modal proportions that reflect the observed mode split for leisure trips in the TTS. These assigned proportions are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:chp3-mode_split_eachDB_plots.png}. Notably, areas of high walking share align closely with where the downtown core and built up areas of the city lie. Conversely, these areas also display lower car mode share.

## Methods: constrainted and unconstrained accessibility measures 

In this section, we outline the methods outlined in Chapter 2, but specify each variable in terms of parkland as opportunities at destination $D_j$, people as population $O_i$, and a their multimodal extension. This includes:

For **Chapter 4**:
1. Unimodal total constrained **accessible parkland** summarised per each DB $V_i^T$; All people to all parkland by walking will be assessed: all people will be assumed to be walking. Can be interpreted as "how much parkland area is potentially reachable by the walking-population from this park?". Will be presented as a 'parkland provision' ratio of parkland per walking-population. 
2. Unimodal total constrained **accessible population** summarised per park $M_j^T$; the transpose of $V_i^T$. Namely, all parkland to all people by walking will be assessed. Can be interpreted as "how much walking-population is potentially reachable from this park?". Will be presented as a potential population 'service catchment' or a ratio of population potential per parkland area.
3. The first two measures will be compared to a unimodal unconstrained **accessible parkland** summarised per each DB $V_i^0$ and **accessible population** summarised per park $M_j^0$, representing the traditional accessibility measure calculation method. Like the other two, all people (assumed to be walking) to all parkland will be assessed. Will be interpreted as "the proportion of parkland area that is potentially reachable by the walking-population from this park" and "the proportion of walking population that is potentially reachable by the park". No 'parkland provision' or 'service catchment' ratio can be calculated.

For **Chapter 5**, additional information regarding modes $m$ is introduced, namely 1) the population at each origin DB is split to represent 'walking', 'cycling', 'transit' and 'car' modes based on observed TTS data, with their associated travel cost $c_{ij}^m$ to parkland and travel impedance function $f^m (c^m_{ij})$. And 2) the parkland at each destination is split to reflect the likelihood that they'll be visited by mode. This split is based on the parkland normative classification, namely that small parks are attractive based on walking and cycling impedance, while larger parks are attractive based on all modal impedance. The following measures are solved: 
1. Multimodal singly constrained **accessible parkland** summarised per mode and each DB $V_i^{mS}$; All can be interpreted as the proportion of parkland that is accessible as a function of the multimodal population and multimodal travel impedance.
2. Multimodal singly constrained **accessible population** summarised per mode and park destination $M_j^{mS}$; Can be interpreted as the proportion of population that is accessible as a function of the multimodal parkland (i.e., magnetic quality associated with the park) and associated parkland travel impedance. Will also be presented as a potential population 'service catchment' or a ratio of population potential per $m$-type of parkland area.
3. The first two measures will be compared to unimodal unconstrained **accessible parkland** calculated for each mode summarised for each DB $V_i^{0}$ and park $M_j^{0}$, representing the traditional approach to calculating multimodal accessibility measure. Like the other two results. Will be interpreted as "the proportion of parkland area that is potentially reachable by the walking-population from this park". No 'parkland provision' ratio can be calculated.

For both **Chapter 4** and **Chapter 5**, per population and per opportunity ratios at different zonal aggregations for all members (variants and multimodal extensions) are calculated, and their meanings interpreted and compared. 

Across all equations, in this empirical example refer to:
- Each zone can be either origins $i$ or destinations $j$ in the same system. However, in this empirical case $i$s and $j$s are distinct, but still within the same system (city). Each $i$ is a dissemination block (DB) and each destination is a park $j$.
- $m$ is an index indicating the type of multimodal quality of either the origin-zone-mass (population) or destination-zone-mass (parkland); $m$ is either "walk", "cycle", "transit" and "car".
- $f(c_{ij})$ is the function of the cost of travel expressed in travel time $c_{ij}$ from $i$ to $j$. In the multimodal variation,  $f^m(c^m_{ij})$ is defined for different $m$s (e.g., travel time and the travel function from an origin to a destination for "walk" is distinct than "car")
- the destination zone attraction mass $W_j^{(2)}$ is the number of opportunities (i.e., the parkland in hectares at a park $j$); A multimodal expression of this mass is expressed as $W_j^{m(2)}$. $W_j^{(2)}$ refers to a known marginal in a zone (i.e., parkland area at a $j$ that is allocated or used for allocation) it is denoted as $D_j$, when it refers to the known total marginal sum in the region $D$ (i.e., total parkland area in the city that is allocated). 
- the origin zone production mass $W_i^{(1)}$ is the number of population (i.e., the population at a DB $i$); A multimodal expression of this mass is expressed as $W_i^{m(1)}$. $W_i^{(1)}$ refers to a known marginal in a zone (i.e., population at a $i$ that is allocated or used for allocation) it is denoted as $O_i$, when it refers to the known total marginal sum in the region $O$ (i.e., total population in the city that is allocated). 

### Methods for Chapter 4: unimodal accessibility

#### Unconstrained accessible parkland and population: proportional to the supply of parks and people reachable weighted by travel impedance

Re-stating \ref{eq:unconstrained-accessibility}), a summary of $V_{ij}^0$ for each $i$ \ref{eq:unconstrained-access}):

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:unconstrained-accessibility}
V^0_i = \sum_j V^0_{ij} = \sum_j W^{(2)}_j f(c_{ij}) = S_i
\end{equation} 
```

Where $V^0_{ij}$ is the number of parkland-area-$f^\text{walk}(c^{walk}_{ij})$ at each $i$ from $j$. It can be summarised for each $i$ and hence $V^0_i$ is equivalent to Hansen's accessibility $S_i$.

Likewise, \ref{eq:unconstrained-market}) depicts the the concept of market potential $M_j^0$  expressed as a transpose of $V^0_{ij}$:
```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:unconstrained-market}
M_j^0 = \sum_i M^0_{ji} = \sum_i W_i^{(1)} f(c_{ij})
\end{equation} 
```

Where $M^0_{ji}$ is the number of population-$f^\text{walk}(c^{walk}_{ij})$ at each $j$ from $i$. It can be summarised for each $j$ and hence expressed as $M^0_j$.

#### Total constrained accessibility:

This member of measure should be used when information that justifies constraining the opportunities (or population) at each zone is unavailable--leaving only the justification of allocating the regional total (of opportunities in the case of accessible opportunities or population in the case of accessible population). 

In the variant of **accessible opportunities** measure, this situation arises when opportunities are not zonally competitive, that is, they can be freely allocated to zones based solely on travel impedance, without accounting for zonal demand of the population. In effect, this measure assumes the population demands the opportunities uniformly across each zone. 

Similarly, for **accessible population** , this variant should be applied when population is treated as non-competitive. This measure freely allocates the total population to opportunity zones based on travel impedance, without regard to the capacity or supply of those zones in terms of opportunities. This measure assumes the population is uniformly "supplied" to opportunities throughout the region.

##### Accessible parkland: constrained to the total supply of parkland

Re-stating \ref{eq:total-constrained-accessibility}), the total constrained accessible opportunities measure $V^T_{i}$ now becomes Hansen's accessibility with a balancing factor $K^T$:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:total-constrained-accessibility}
V^T_i = \sum_j V^T_{ij} = K^T \sum_j W^{(2)}_j f(c_{ij}) = K^T V^0_i
\end{equation} 
```

Where: 
- $V^T_{ij}$ is the parkland area accessible at $i$ from $j$ that can be summarised as the parkland accessible at $i$ $V^T_{i}$;
- $K^T$ is the balancing factor reflecting the total constraint (Equation \ref{eq:total-constraint-accessibility}), i.e., ensuring that the sum of all the accessible parkland area is equal to the total parkland in the city ($\sum_i\sum_j V^T_{ij} = \sum_i V^T_{i} = D$)  $\frac{W^{(2)}_j}{\sum_i\sum_j W^{(2)}_jf(c_{ij})}$ that serves to proportionally allocate the opportunities $D$ in the region and ensures units remain balanced.

Put another way: $V^T_i$ sums all $V^T_{ij}$ for a specific $i$ (i.e., $V^T_i = \sum_j V^T_{ij}$). $V^T_i$ is linearly proportional to the Hansen-type accessibility measure $S_i = W^{(2)}_jf(c_{ij})$. Furthermore, $V_{ij}^T$ can be written to be equal to $\kappa_{ij}^T D$ where the dimensionless proportional allocation factor ($\kappa_{ij}^T = \frac{W_j^{(2)} f(c_{ij})}{\sum_i\sum_j W^{(2)}_jf(c_{ij})}$) allocates $D$ to each $i$ corresponding to each $j$, explicitly communicating that each $V_{ij}^T$ is a proportion of $D$. 

##### Accessible population: constrained to the total demanding population

Re-stating \ref{eq:total-constrained-market}), the total constrained accessible population measure now becomes traditional market potential with a balancing factor $\hat K^T$:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:total-constrained-market}
M^T_{j} = \sum_i M^T_{ji} = \hat K^T \sum_i W_i^{(1)} f(c_{ij}) = \hat K^T M_{j}^0
\end{equation} 
```

Where:
- $M^T_{ji}$ is the number of population accessible at $j$ from $i$ that can be summarised as the population accessible at $j$ $M^T_{j}$, 
- $\hat K^T$ is the balancing factor reflecting the total constraint, i.e., ensuring that the sum of all the accessible population is equal to the population in the city ($\sum_i\sum_j M^T_{ji} = \sum_j M^T_{j} = O$)  $\frac{W^{(1)}_i}{\sum_i\sum_j W^{(1)}_if(c_{ij})}$ that serves to proportionally allocate the population $O$ in the region and ensures units remain balanced.

As well, $M^T_{ji}$ can be written to be equal to $\hat\kappa_{ij}^T O$ where the dimensionless proportional allocation factor ($\hat \kappa_{ij}^T = \frac{W_i^{(1)} f(c_{ij})}{\sum_i\sum_j W^{(1)}_i f(c_{ij})}$) allocates $O$ to each $j$ corresponding to each $i$, explicitly communicating that each $M^T_{ji}$ is a proportion of $O$. 

#### Singly constrained accessibility:

This member of measure should be used when we know more information: namely, we know that the amount of parkland (or population) should be allocated based on the origin-mass demand (or destination-mass supply). This builds on the 'total constrained' measure, where now the opportunities (or population) can be considered competitive (or responding to competition).

So: in the variant of **accessible opportunities**, this variant should be applied when opportunities are seen as zonally competitive, that is, they should be allocated to zones based on the population's zonal demand as well as travel impedance. This measure assumes the zonal demand of the population and distributes zonal opportunities based on this demand (and travel impedance). 

Similarly, for **accessible population**, this variant should be applied when population is treated as zonally competitive, that is, population should be allocated to zones based on the zonal parkland supply as well as travel impedance. This variant assumes the zonal population is allocated to zones based on their opportunity "supply" (and travel impedance).

##### Accessible parkland: constrained to the total and marginal supply of parkland 

Equation \ref{eq:opportunity-constrained-accessibility} is re-stated as follows:
```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:opportunity-constrained-accessibility}
V^S_{i} = \sum_j V^S_{ij} = \sum_j B_j D_j W_i^{(1)} f(c_{ij})
\end{equation} 
```

Where: 
- $V^S_{ij}$ is the parkland area accessible considering population demand at $i$ from $j$. It can be summarised as $V^S_{i}$: the parkland accessible at $i$;
- $B_j$ is the balancing factor reflecting the opportunity constraint, i.e., ensuring that the sum of accessible parkland area considering population demand $V^S_{ij}$ allocated from a specific $j$ is equal to the parkland from that $j$ (i.e., Equation \ref{eq:opportunity-constraint} $\sum_i V^S_{ij} =  D_j$). This constraint also satisfies the total constraint (Equation \ref{eq:total-constraint-accessibility}) and ensures units remain balanced.

$V_{ij}^S$ can be written to be equal to $\kappa_{ij}^S D_j$ where the dimensionless proportional allocation factor ($\kappa_{ij}^S = \frac{W_i^{(1)} f(c_{ij})}{\sum_i W_i^{(1)} f(c_{ij})}$) allocates $D_j$ to each $i$, explicitly communicating that each $i$ to $j$ is a  a proportion of $D_j$ and implicitly $D$.

##### Accessible population: constrained to the total and marginal demanding population

Re-stating \ref{eq:population-constrained-accessibility}), the total constrained accessible population measure now becomes traditional market potential with a balancing factor $A_i$:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:population-constrained-accessibility}
M^S_j = \sum_i M^T_{ji} = \sum_i A_i O_i W_j^{(2)} f(c_{ij})
\end{equation} 
```

Where:
- $M^S_{ji}$ is the number of population accessible considering parkland supply at $j$ from $i$. It can be summarised as $M^S_{j}$: the population accessible at $j$;
- $A_i$ is the balancing factor reflecting the population constraint, i.e., ensuring that the sum of accessible population considering parkland supply $V^M_{ij}$ allocated from a specific $i$ is equal to the population from that $i$ (i.e., Equation \ref{eq:population-constraint} $\sum_j M^S_{ji} =  O_i$). This constraint also satisfies the total constraint (Equation \ref{eq:total-constraint-market}) and ensures units remain balanced.

$M_{ji}^S$ can be written to be equal to $\hat \kappa_{ij}^S O_i$ where the dimensionless proportional allocation factor ($\hat \kappa_{ij}^S = \frac{W_j^{(2)} f(c_{ij})}{\sum_j W_j^{(2)} f(c_{ij})}$) allocates $D_i$ to each $j$, explicitly communicating that each $j$ to $i$ is a proportion of $O_i$ and implicitly $O$.

### Methods for Chapter 5: Multimodal accessibility

#### Unconstrained accessible parkland and population by multiple modes

Re-stating \ref{eq:unconstrained-multimodal-accessibility}):
```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:unconstrained-multimodal-accessibility}
V^{m0}_{i} = \sum_j V^{m0}_{ij} = \sum_j W_j^{(2)} f^m(c^m_{ij})
\end{equation} 
```

Where $V^{m0}_{ij}$ is the amount of parkland-area-$f^{m}(c^{m}_{ij})$ at each $i$ from $j$ for a specific $m$. It can be summarised for each $i$ and hence $V^{m0}_i$ is equivalent to Hansen's accessibility $S_i$ calculated for a specific mode $m$.

Likewise, \ref{eq:unconstrained-multimodal-market}) depicts the the concept of market potential expressed as a transpose of $V^{m0}_{ij}$:
```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:unconstrained-multimodal-market}
M_j^{m0} = \sum_i M^{m0}_{ji} = \sum_i W_i^{(1)} f^m(c^m_{ij})
\end{equation} 
```

Where $M^{m0}_{ji}$ is the number of population-$f^m(c^{m}_{ij})$ at each $j$ from $i$. It can be summarised for each $j$ and hence expressed as $M^{m0}_j$.

Both multimodal extensions $V^{m0}_{i}$ and $M^{m0}_{j}$ are not truly 'multimodal', as they are not a function of _all_ modes in the system. Instead, an analyst must adjust the units post-calculation (e.g., scaling, normalization) or select impedance functions to facilitate comparison across scenarios (potentially at the expense of accurately reflecting travel behavior). Such adjustments may introduce bias. Hence, the raw unconstrained accessibility values themselves are challenging to compare due to their units. However, $V^{m0}_{i}$ and $M^{m0}_{j}$ are included as a point of comparison for the multimodal scenarios against the following accessibility measures (total constrained and singly constrained multimodal accessibility).

#### Total constrained multimodal accessibility: 

The multimodal extension of this member of measure should be used when we know more information: similar to when one would use the unimodal version, but now this information must be known for multiple modes $m$. Namely, the multimodal extension should be used when it is known that the amount of parkland (or population) should be allocated based on the origin-mass demand (or destination-mass supply) and the matching marginal is qualified by $m$-specific travel impedance function $f^m(c^m_{ij})$ .

The multimodal extension of the **accessible opportunities** measure variant of this member should be applied when opportunities are seen as zonally competitive, that is, they should be allocated to zones based on a $m$-specific split of population's zonal demand as well as its corresponding $m$ travel impedance. This measure could reflect the number of accessible parkland per $m$ at an $i$ based on the allocation of parkland from each $j$ to the different $m$-populations at each $i$ (and their associated $m$ travel impedance). In this empirical example, there will be four values per $i$, each reflecting the amount of parkland that is accessible for the 'walking', 'cycling', 'transit-using' and 'car-using' populations (different $m$s) given their different travel impedance ($f^m(c^m_{ij})$).

Similarly, the multimodal extension of the  **accessible population** measure should be applied when population is treated as zonally competitive, that is, population should be allocated to zones based on the $m$-specific supply of parkland and their associated $m$ travel impedance. In this empirical example, there will be four $m$ specific values per park $j$, each reflecting the amount of population that is accessible for the 'walking', 'cycling', 'transit-using' and 'car-using' populations (different $m$s) given their different travel impedance ($f^m(c^m_{ij})$). 

##### Accessible parkland by modal-qualities of population: constrained to the total of parkland

Equation \ref{eq:total-constrained-multimodal-access} is restated below:
```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:total-constrained-multimodal-access}
V^{mT}_{i} = \sum_j V^{mT}_{ij} = K^{mT} W_j^{(2)} f^m(c^m_{ij})
\end{equation} 
```

Where: 
- $V^{mT}_{ij}$ is the parkland area accessible at $i$ from $j$ for a specific $m$ (either walking, cycling, transit or motorist)--a subset of the origin-mass (population) at that $i$. It can be summarised as the parkland accessible at $i$ for a specific $m$ $V^{mT}_{i}$;
- $K^{mT}$ is the balancing factor reflecting the total constraint (Equation \ref{eq:total-constraint-accessibility}), i.e., ensuring that the sum of all the accessible parkland area is equal to the total parkland in the city ($\sum_m\sum_i\sum_j V^{mT}_{ij} = \sum_m \sum_i V^{mT}_{i} = D$)  $\frac{W^{(2)}_j}{\sum_m\sum_i\sum_j W^{(2)}_jf^m(c^m_{ij})}$ that serves to proportionally allocate the opportunities $D$ in the region and ensures units remain balanced.

$V_{ij}^{mT}$ can be written to be equal to $\kappa_{ij}^{mT} D$ where the dimensionless proportional allocation factor ($\kappa_{ij}^{mT} = \frac{W_j^{(2)} f^m(c^m_{ij})}{\sum_m\sum_i\sum_j W^{(2)}_jf^m(c^m_{ij})}$) allocates $D$ to each $m$ at $i$ corresponding to opportunities at $j$, explicitly communicating that each $V_{ij}^{mT}$ is a proportion of $D$. 

##### Accessible population by modal-qualities of parks: constrained to the total demanding population

Equation \ref{eq:total-constrained-multimodal-market} is restated: 
```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:total-constrained-multimodal-market}
M^{mT}_{j} = \sum_i M^{mT}_{ji} = \hat K^{mT} W_j^{(2)} f^m(c^m_{ij})
\end{equation} 
```

Where: 
- $M^{mT}_{ji}$ is the population accessible at $j$ from $i$ for a specific $m$ (either walking, cycling, transit or motorist)--a subset of the destination-mass (population) at that $i$. It can be summarised as $M^{mT}_{j}$, the population accessible at $j$ for a specific $m$;
- $\hat K^{mT}$ is the balancing factor reflecting the total constraint (Equation \ref{eq:total-constraint-accessibility}) but from the perspective of the sum of the total population marginal, i.e., ensuring that the sum of all the accessible population is equal to the total population in the city ($\sum_m \sum_i\sum_j M^{mT}_{ji} = \sum_m \sum_j M^{mT}_{j} = O$)  $\frac{W^{(1)}_i}{\sum_m\sum_i\sum_j W^{(1)}_if^m(c^m_{ji})}$ that serves to proportionally allocate the opportunities $D$ in the region and ensures units remain balanced.

$M_{ji}^{mT}$ can be written to be equal to $\hat \kappa_{ji}^{mT} O$ where the dimensionless proportional allocation factor ($\hat \kappa_{ji}^{mT} = \frac{W_i^{(1)} f^m(c^m_{ji})}{\sum_m\sum_i\sum_j W^{(1)}_if^m(c^m_{ji})}$) allocates $O$ to each $m$ at $j$ corresponding to population at $i$, explicitly communicating that each $M_{ji}^{mT}$ is a proportion of $O$. 

#### Singly constrained multimodal accessibility:

This member of measure should be used when we know more information: namely, we know not only the amount of parkland (or population) that should be allocated based on the origin-mass demand (or destination-mass supply) but also specific types of $m$ at each $i$ (or $j$) and their associated $f^m(c^m_{ij})$ that should dictate this proportional allocation. This extension on the 'total constrained' multimodal measure, where now the opportunities (or population) can be considered competitive (or responding to competition) in a multimodal sense.

In the multimodal **accessible opportunities** variant, opportunities are seen as zonally competitive, that is, they should be allocated to origins based on the $m$-population's zonal demand as well as their $m$ specific travel impedance. In this empirical example, there will four values per $i$, each reflecting the amount of parkland that is accessible for the 'walking', 'cycling', 'transit-using' and 'car-using' populations (different $m$s) given their different travel impedance ($f^m(c^m_{ij})$) _and_ the proportion of their $m$-populations themselves i.e., DB A will have some X number of parkland accessible by walking, Y by cycling, Z by transit and ZZ by car given their relative travel impedance $m$s _and_ amount of $m$-using population. 

Similarly, for the multimodal **accessible population** variant, population is treated as zonally competitive hence allocated to destinations based on the $m$-opportunity's zonal supply as well as their $m$ specific travel impedance. In this empirical example, there will be four $m$ specific values per park $j$, each reflecting the amount of population that is accessible for the 'walking', 'cycling', 'transit-using' and 'car-using' populations (different $m$s) given their different travel impedance ($f^m(c^m_{ij})$) _and_ the proportion of their $m$-specific parkland themselves, i.e., park A will have some X number of people accessible by walking, Y by cycling, Z by transit and ZZ by car given their relative travel impedance $m$s _and_ amount of $m$-attractive parkland.  

##### Accessible parkland by modal-qualities of population: constrained to the total and marginal supply of parkland

Restating Equation \ref{eq:singly-constrained-multimodal-accessibility}:
```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:singly-constrained-multimodal-accessibility}
V^{mS}_{i} = \sum_j V^{mS}_{ij} = B_j^{m} D_j W_i^{m(1)} f^m(c^m_{ij})
\end{equation} 
```
Where: 
- $V^{mS}_{ij}$ is the parkland area accessible at $i$ from $j$ for a specific $m$ (either walking, cycling, transit or motorist)--a subset of the origin-mass (population) considering $m$-population demand at $i$s and $m$-specific travel impedance. 
- $B_j^{m}$ is the $B_j$ considering $m$s and reflects the opportunity constraint, i.e., ensuring that the $\sum_m V^{mS}_{ij}$ (sum of accessible parkland area considering population demand) allocated from a specific $j$ is equal to the parkland from that $j$ (i.e., Equation \ref{eq:opportunity-constraint} $\sum_m \sum_i V^{nS}_{ij} =  D_j$). This constraint also satisfies the total constraint (Equation \ref{eq:total-constraint-accessibility}) and ensures units remain balanced.

$V_{ij}^{mS}$ can be written to be equal to $\kappa_{ij}^{mS} D_j$ where the dimensionless proportional allocation factor ($\kappa_{ij}^{mS} = \frac{W_i^{m(1)} f^m(c^m_{ij})}{\sum_m\sum_i W_i^{m(1)} f^m(c^m_{ij})}$) allocates $D_j$ to each $m$ at each $i$, explicitly communicating that each $m$ at each $i$ to $j$ is a proportion of $D_j$ and implicitly all sums to equal $D$.

##### Accessible population by modal-qualities of parks: constrained to the total and marginal demanding population

Restating Equation \ref{eq:singly-constrained-multimodal-market}:
```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:singly-constrained-multimodal-market}
M^{mS}_{ji} = \sum_i M^{mS}_{ji} = A_i^{m} O_i W_j^{m(2)} f^m(c^m_{ij})
\end{equation} 
```
Where: 
- $M^{mS}_{ji}$ is the population accessible at $j$ from $i$ for a specific $m$ (either walking, cycling, transit or motorist)--a subset of the destination-mass (opportunity) considering $m$-parkland supply at $j$s and $m$-specific travel impedance. 
- $A_i^{m}$ is the $A_i$ considering $m$s and reflects the population constraint, i.e., ensuring that the $\sum_m M^{mS}_{ji}$ (sum of accessible population considering parkland supply) allocated from a specific $i$ is equal to the population from that $i$ (i.e., Equation \ref{eq:population-constraint} $\sum_m \sum_j M^{mS}_{ji} =  O_i$). This constraint also satisfies the total constraint (Equation \ref{eq:total-constraint-accessibility}) and ensures units remain balanced.

$M_{ji}^{mS}$ can be written to be equal to $\hat \kappa_{ji}^{mS} O_i$ where the dimensionless proportional allocation factor ($\hat \kappa_{ji}^{mS} =  \frac{W_j^{m(2)} f^m(c^m_{ij})}{\sum_m\sum_j W_j^{m(2)} f^m(c^m_{ij})}$) allocates $O_i$ to each $m$ at each $j$, explicitly communicating that each $m$ at each $j$ to $i$ is a proportion of $O_i$ and implicitly all sums to equal $O$.

### For both Chapter 4 and 5: Representing constrained accessibility as a ratios 

Referring to **accessible opportunities**, i.e., $V_{ij}^T$ & $V_{ij}^{mT}$, and $V_{ij}^{S}$ & $V_{ij}^{mS}$, are represented per capita and aggregated at different zonal levels to reflect **potential parkland provision**:

Accessible parkland area per capita at a DB:
```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:total-constrained-access-per-capita}
v^{T}_{i} = \frac{V^{T}_{i}}{O_{i}}
\end{equation} 
```

Accessible parkland area per $m$ per capita at a DB:
```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:total-constrained-multimodal-access-per-capita}
v^{mT}_{i} = \frac{V^{mT}_{i}}{O_{i}}
\end{equation} 
```

This can likewise be applied to market potential. Referring to **accessible population**, i.e., summaries of $M_{ji}^T$ & $M_{ji}^{mT}$, and $M_{ji}^{S}$ & $M_{ji}^{mS}$, are represented per parkland type and aggregated at different zonal levels to reflect **potential population serviced**.

Accessible population per parkland area at a park:
```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:total-constrained-market-per-capita}
m^{T}_{j} = \frac{m^{T}_{j}}{D_{j}}
\end{equation} 
```

Accessible population per $m$ per parkland area at a park:
```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:total-constrained-multimodal-market-per-capita}
m^{mT}_{j} = \frac{m^{mT}_{j}}{D_{j}}
\end{equation} 
```

## Chapter conclusions

This chapter includes all the City of Toronto population and parkland data included in the accessibility analysis (chapters 4 and 5) as well as the restatement of accessibility equations.
