## Overview
This frames opportunities as hectares of parkland for one type, Large park, as all modes are present in the normative impedance. We will assume everyone walks, and hence the population of walkers is equal to the population at the origin. To keep it simple, just walking as a mode will be analysed, either 1 or 0 binary function at different thresholds. 

First, these assumptions will yield values of $V^0_i$, $V^T_i$ and $V^S_i$ as the accessible parkland along with per capita ratios in discussion with potential parkland service provision. 

Next, $M^0_j$, $M^T_j$ and $M^S_j$ as the accessible population along with per parkland ratios in discussion with potential population served. 

## Accessible parkland (for the population)
Focusing on the accessible number of parks: the following plot demonstrates a disaggregated version of figure above. Each plot demonstrates the number of parks that are accessible, assuming walking mode. Again, the embedded assumption is the number of parkland in the city is allocated to each DB based on the travel impedance of that mode's zone relative to all the travel impedance of all modes in the region.

## Accessible population (to the parkland)

The 'number of people that can access parks' for the zonal unit of question.

## Potential improvements (singly constrained only able to do this for)

- DBs that have low parkland service -- DBs that should have more parks (if access is improved) -- ID those that are in equity seeking neighbourhoods.
- Parks that have low population service provision -- parks that can serve more people (if access is improved) -- ID those that are in equity seeking neighbourhoods.
