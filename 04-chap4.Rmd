THIS CHAPTER WILL frames opportunities as hectares of parkland for one type, Large park, as all modes are present in the normative impedances. We will assume everyone walks, and hence the population of walkers is equal to the population at the origin. To keep it simple, just walking as a mode will be analysised, either 1 or 0 binary function at different thresholds. 

These assumptions will yield values of $V^0_i$, $V^T_i$ and $V^S_i$ as the 'access to parkland'. As well as $V^0_i$, $V^T_i$ and $V^S_i$

## Results

The figure demonstrates the accessible to all parks for each DB (recall, out of the total 1607 parks), as an overview of the city. 
[1 Toronto DB plot - featuring accessibility to all parks considering 'average' modal impedance]

If interested in the coverage of the parks, the following figure demonstrates the accessibility to people for each DB, in the context of their travel to parks.

### Potential access to parks

Focusing on the accessible number of parks: the following plot demonstrates a disaggregated version of figure above. Each plot demonstrates the number of parks that are accessible, by mode. Again, the embedded assumption is the number of parkland in the city is allocated to each DB based on the travel impedance of that mode's zone relative to all the travel impedance of all modes in the region.

[4 Toronto DB plots, summarised by neighbourhood - featuring accessibility to ONLY large parks by mode]

[4 Toronto DB plots, summarised by neighbourhood - featuring accessibility to ONLY small parks by mode]

[4 Toronto DB plots - featuring accessibility to all parks per capita by mode]

[summary table of top 5, middle 5, and bottom 5 neighbourhoods]


### Potential access to peopulation

If interested in using totally-constrained accessibility as an indicator of service provision, conceptualing the 'market pontential' variant is useful to yield values of 'number of people that can access parks' for the zonal unit of question. 

The following is the access to people, by mode. Notably, it is not correlated with opportunities, as there is a mis-match in population and parkland in certain neighbourhood (see fig..X)
