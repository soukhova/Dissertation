Concluding...

-  open and reproducibility of methods learned are discussed (text from _"TTS2016R: A data set to study population and employment patterns from the 2016 Transportation Tomorrow Survey in the Greater Golden Horseshoe area, Ontario, Canada"_ is included)
- how constrained measures can be interpreted, 
- how this interpretation can aid policy makers-- per capita, per any other zonal property. comparisions between regions, between times.
- how policy makers can ultimately use this to plan for inequities (some text pulled from _"Searching for fairness standards in the transportation literature"_). 
- Future research directions (?)



DESTINATIONS -- in flux in their competition. 
- hyper competitive (limited opps + required qualitifcations)-- like employment, and post-secondary education
- competitive and institional (imited opps creates competitive experiences, open to and essential for whole population/subgroup) -- like primary, and sceondary education, child care centre, healthcare facilities
