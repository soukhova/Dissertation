## Dissertation Summary

Though accessibility can be defined in many ways, most trace back to @hansen1959: "the potential of opportunities for interaction..." (p. 73). Yet within this definition, a key question remains unresolved: does accessibility have units? One could argue, as this dissertation does, that accessibility should be in the units of  _opportunities_ that are up for potential spatially interaction. In current practice, however, accessibility is often treated as unitless, which undermines clarity and comparability. To address this, this dissertation develops a detailed motivation, proposes a methodological framework that restores units via a 'family of accessibility measures', and uses a Toronto-based case study to demonstrate how the absence of defined units limits interpretability and descriptive analysis.

More specifically, this dissertation offers a novel approach to the accessibility literature by adopting balancing factors from spatial interaction modelling literature into the accessibility context. These balancing factors keep accessibility results comparable to conventional accessibility measurement methods but ensure values retain meaningful units--units tied to tangible system characteristics, such as the total number of opportunities in a region or the known number at a specific destination. The contributions of this dissertation are four-fold:

- First, it explicitly links accessibility to spatial interaction through their shared intellectual foundations (pre- @hansen1959), highlighting how contemporary accessibility research has diverged and showing the mathematical, intuitive, and interpretative advantages of preserving units through constrained formulations, as done in spatial interaction modeling.
- Second, it introduces the total constrained accessibility measure as an alternative to the Hansen-type formulation, producing zonal values that represent proportions of the known number of destination masses (i.e., opportunities) or origin masses (i.e., population) in the region.
- Third, it presents the singly constrained accessibility measure as a competitive method that proportionally allocates opportunities from the destination based on population demand (from the origin), or in the case of market potential, proportional allocation of population from the origin based on the supply of opportunities at the destination. Its per-capita zonal rate is shown to be mathematically equivalent to the widely used two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method [@luo2003; @shen1998].
- Fourth, responding to the scarcity of coherent multimodal accessibility frameworks in the literature, this work extends both the total- and singly-constrained accessibility measures to account for multiple modes of transportation.

The **first contribution** of this dissertation, presented in Chapter 1, revisits the widely cited definition of accessibility from @hansen1959: "the potential of opportunities for interaction... a generalization of the population-over-distance relationship or population potential concept developed by @stewartDemographicGravitationEvidence1948" (p. 73). This work traces this definition back to its Newtonian roots in human spatial interaction modeling, beginning with @ravensteinLawsMigration1885, and investigates how the units of "the potential of opportunities for interaction" were originally defined. This probing review leads to the family of spatial interaction models developed by @wilson1971, particularly his introduction of balancing factors designed to reflect known system constraints--such as the total constraint, and the production and attraction constraints (represented in Equations \ref{eq:constraint0-gravitymodel}, \ref{eq:constraint1-gravitymodel}, and \ref{eq:constraint2-gravitymodel}). Notably, while these models formalized interaction mechanisms using system constraints, the concept of accessibility itself was not explicitly or meaningfully developed within.

Having established that spatial interaction and accessibility share common roots, the chapter next examines how these two bodies of literature have interacted in the contemporary era. It reviews works that cite both @hansen1959 and @wilson1971 and reveals that, despite their shared origins, accessibility and spatial interaction modeling literatures have largely remained distinct. One stream of the literature is more focused on spatial interaction modeling and cites @hansen1959 as the father of the accessibility concept and/or uses accessibility as a variable (or additional variable) within the spatial interaction model itself. In these cases, accessibility is treated as conceptually related to spatial interaction, but the connection is not clearly or practically clarified. Another body of work is more accessibility-focused and is mostly part of the contemporary accessibility literature which gained momentum in the early 2000s. These accessibility-focused works cite @wilson1971 for a variety of general reasons, but none (other than @soukhovIntroducingSpatialAvailability2023 and @soukhovMultimodalSpatialAvailability2024) cite the rationale of Wilson's constraints.

Beginning with this rationale in Chapter 2, the balancing factors, akin to those used in Wilson's family of spatial interaction models, are introduced in the context of accessibility. The chapter details the interpretive advantages of these factors, particularly their ability to produce accessibility values with meaningful units (e.g., a share of opportunities in the region) while incorporating system-wide or zonal constraints based on known quantities. Overall, Chapter 2 presents a 'family of accessibility measures', constructed using the constrained intuition of Wilson’s spatial interaction models, and illustrated through a simple toy example. Alongside the conventional formulation of accessibility as the potential of opportunities for spatial interaction--or simply, "accessible opportunities" from a zone--Chapter 2 also defines its transpose: the potential of population for interaction or 'market potential'.

This dissertation is among the first to investigate the relationship between spatial interaction modeling and accessibility measures in the contemporary era, which is its  **first contribution**. This dissertation applies the constraining mechanism of balancing factors--not only to the measurement of accessible opportunities, but also to accessible population (i.e., market potential). This introduces a methodology to the accessibility literature that produces unprocessed accessibility outputs that can be directly interpreted in units of opportunities (or population) for potential spatial interaction at a zone.

The **second contribution** of this dissertation is the introduction of the total constraint to accessibility measurement. The total constrained measure is conceptually equivalent in magnitude to the Hansen-type accessibility measure (Equation \ref{eq:access-unconstrained}) but is expressed in meaningful units--the number of accessible opportunities at a given zone, or accessible population in the case of market potential. As such, the total constrained measure remains compatible with the commonly used Hansen-type measure (or unconstrained, as referred to in this work), while offering improved interpretability of the resulting raw values.

The total constrained accessibility's formulation is presented in Chapter 2, and an empirical example focused on accessible parks in terms of parkland area and population is detailed in Chapter 3 (data and methods) and Chapter 4 (results) with a unimodal example, only considering accessibility by walking. In these empirical results, the total parkland area in the region is proportionally allocated to each origin zone through the total constrained proportionality factor that ensures it remains proportion to the unconstrained measure. However, unlike unconstrained measures, the resulting values are expressed in known, interpretable units. This leads to several practical and promising advantages: the values can be intuitively understood, aggregated across different spatial scales (e.g., neighbourhoods with varying equity classifications), and expressed on a per capita basis. This per capita framing enables direct comparison against policy-relevant benchmarks, such as Toronto’s standard of 12 sqm of parkland per person [@toronto_parkland2019].

Without units tied to tangible system quantities--such as total parkland area or total population--such comparisons would be far less clear. This interpretability makes the approach especially promising for applied researchers and practitioners seeking to inform equitable planning and policy decisions.

This dissertation's **third contribution** is the introduction of the singly constrained accessibility measure, formulated in Chapter 2 and 3, and applied alongside the unconstrained and total constrained accessibility measures in Chapter 4 focusing on accessible parkland area (from origins) and accessible population (to parks) in a unimodal, walking-only context.

The singly constrained measure applies a single constraint--either at the destination (opportunity side) or the origin (population side)--ensuring that the total amount of opportunities or population is preserved and proportionally allocated. In doing so, it implicitly satisfies the total constraint. For example, when parkland area (opportunities) are constrained, they are proportionally allocated to each origin zone based on relative accessibility, while ensuring that the total amount of parkland area allocated from each park matches the actual total regional supply of parkland area. This captures competition for opportunities across zones, an aspect that is not considered in the total constrained accessibility measure.

Put another way, the singly constrained measure (in the case of accessible opportunities) accounts for the exhaustibility of opportunities. While the total constrained approach distributes the regional total based on travel impedance-weighted accessibility, it may over- or under-allocate individual parkland area. For example, parks that tend to be over-allocated are larger and in more central and reachable areas; so these parks end up contributing more accessible area relative to the area they physically have. This relative over-allocation is an indicator that, spatially the park is centrally located and could be facing issues of population congestion. In contrast, the singly constrained measure ensures that each park’s contribution is limited to its actual size, allocated proportionally among populations based on both proximity and demand, effectively folding in this concept of 'population congestion' within the measure itself. This leads to a more sensitive accessibility that accounts for population competition, i.e., large parks that are centrally located can still be highly accessible, but competition from surrounding populations moderates the accessible parkland area that is proportionally allocated.

The per capita variant of the singly constrained measure is mathematically equivalent to the popular Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (2SFCA) method [@luo2003], so it too fits neatly within the accessibility literature. Like the total constrained measure, the singly constrained measure allows for intuitive aggregation at larger spatial units (e.g., neighbourhoods) and supports comparisons with politically relevant benchmarks, such as Toronto’s parkland supply threshold (e.g., 12 sqm per capita in @toronto_parkland2019).

By measuring accessibility under the assumption that opportunities (or population, in the case of market potential) are exhaustible, the singly constrained measure offers a practical and interpretable framework for applied researchers and practitioners. It enables analysts to incorporate information about both origin and destination "marginals"--even when the specific interaction between them is not known. This makes the singly constrained accessibility measure particularly well-suited for applications where understanding localized competition for exhaustible resources (like park space) is important.

The **fourth contribution** of this dissertation is the multimodal extension of both the total- and singly-constrained accessibility measures. This development responds to a notable gap in the accessibility literature, where coherent approaches to multimodal accessibility remain underdeveloped. By extending the measure to incorporate multiple transportation modes (walk, bicycle, transit, and car) with different travel characteristics and corresponding mode-using groups at the origin or mode-specific groups at the destination, this extension broadens the applicability of constrained accessibility and sharpens its intuitive value.

Like in the unimodal contributions: Chapter 2 presents the formal multimodal extensions for both accessible opportunities and accessible population (market potential), Chapter 3 outlines the relevant empirical data, including mode-specific travel impedance functions and mode-using populations and park-side mode-using proportions, and Chapter 4 details the empirical multimodal accessibility results.

In the case of accessible parkland area, multimodal accessibility to parkland area for each DB in Toronto is reported, as well as an expression of the amount of multimodal accessibility by a specific mode-using group for each zone. In this way, differences between the potential for spatial interaction with parkland area between certain mode-using groups (e.g., walking vs. car) is possible within the same framework. For instance, plots that quantify how much more parkland area is accessible by car than walk is quantified, and can be done for other any relevant spatial unit. Additionally, this multimodal extension is explored in the case of multimodal accessible population for each park. 

Together, these **four novel contributions** advance the field of accessibility analysis--methodologically, empirically, and interpretatively by:

- Linking accessibility and spatial interaction modeling through shared theoretical foundations and the use of balancing factors.
- Introducing the total constrained accessibility measure, which offers unit-consistent, interpretable results aligned with real-world quantities without the need for information other than travel impedance values and spatial distribution of opportunities in the case of _accessible opportunities_ or spatial distribution of population in the case of _accessible population_.
- Detailing the singly constrained measure, which incorporates competition and resource exhaustibility (i.e., either opportunity-side single constraint or population-side singly constraint), offering a richer understanding of competitive accessibility.
- Extending both constrained measures into multimodal variants, allowing meaningful comparisons between groups with different travel behaviours within the same framework.

In sum, the constrained accessibility measures developed in this dissertation provide a clearer conceptual and practical bridge between accessibility analysis and spatial interaction modeling. By working in units of accessible opportunities (or population), these constrained methods make results more interpretable, easier to communicate, and directly comparable to known thresholds (e.g., per capita parkland supply standards). The multimodal extension further reveals how high-accessibility groups (e.g., those using faster or more flexible modes) effectively draw access away from others, illustrating competition within shared urban systems.

Because the resulting values maintain consistent units, they can be meaningfully compared across zones, spatial scales, and over time. These methods can address long-standing challenges in accessibility research: the lack of comparability due to inconsistently defined or unitless measures.

<!-- It is not difficult to imagine how future comparisons across time periods, population subgroups, or regional contexts can now be conducted more intuitively. An aspiration of this dissertation is to bring accessibility analysis closer to mainstream urban planning practice. While mobility-based approaches captures where people go, accessibility captures where people can potentially go--a distinction increasingly important for equitable, opportunity-based planning. -->

The constrained accessibility measures introduced here offer methods that are not only theoretically grounded but also interpretable and relatively straightforward. Their flexibility allows them to be expressed per capita or per any zonal attribute, facilitating application across a wide range of policy contexts--from infrastructure planning to social equity assessments. By making accessibility more intuitive and grounded in tangible system metrics, this work aims to support urban planners and policymakers in designing fairer and more opportunity-rich cities.

## Future research directions

The research presented in this dissertation can be expanded along a variety of directions. The following four are detailed:

- Robustness and comparability of accessibility analysis across scenarios, including varying temporal and spatial contexts; 
- The investigation of "potential" in accessibility;
- Multimodal, multipopulation and multiopportunity accessibility analysis that is sensitive to digital opportunities and vulnerable populations; and
- Enhanced planning for equitable and sustainable cities.

The **first** promising direction for future research is examining how constrained accessibility measures can enhance the robustness and comparability of results across scenarios. In particular, these measure may help improve comparability across different temporal and spatial contexts--either within the same region or between different regions--related to the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) and the Modifiable Temporal Unit Problem (MTUP). As noted in existing literature [@horner2004spatial; @tan2017effects], results from spatial analyses are often sensitive to how data are aggregated, both in terms of scale (e.g., the level of spatial resolution, where larger zones may smooth over important local variation) and zoning configuration (i.e., how boundaries are configurated at a given scale). Similarly, temporal aggregations--such as travel time assumptions or peak-period averaging--can also yield different results and potentially quite conclusions [@pereira2019future].

The constrained accessibility measures introduced in this dissertation are designed to express each zonal value as a proportion of a known regional total. This proportional allocation mechanism, by design, enables more consistent and interpretable comparisons, as all zones are evaluated relative to the same regional context. Analysts can select the unit of spatial and temporal analysis based on methodological suitability rather than an ad-hoc manner or driven by interpretability. Analysts can also test the sensitivity of their constrained results to changes in zoning or time intervals.

Moreover, the flexibility of the constrained framework allows analysts to adopt more behaviourally realistic models--such as using an exponential decay function for travel impedance instead of a binary threshold--while maintaining clear and communicable outputs. These enhancements not only support more nuanced methodological choices but may also lead to more valid and policy-relevant insights by better reflecting real-world travel behaviour. Ultimately, using a constrained framework creates more space for methodological complexity and coherent sensitivity testing between scenarios and regions, without scarifying interpretability.

A **second** promising avenue for future research lies in exploring the concept of "potential" within accessibility, its relationship to competition, and the importance of explicitly characterizing the exhaustibility of populations and opportunities prior to conducting an accessibility analysis.

In the total constrained measure, opportunities are treated as fully available to all zones--any zone can access any share of total opportunities, as long as the sum across all zones fits within the regional total. In contrast, the singly constrained measure limits the available opportunities to the actual quantities present at each destination, allocating accessibility based on the population of each origin. Finally, the doubly constrained measure (essentially a doubly constrained spatial interaction model) restricts interactions even further, allowing only the specific amount of opportunities at each destination to be accessed by the specific population at each origin, effectively modeling 'flow'.

As constraints increase, the "potential" for interaction--between populations and opportunities--becomes progressively limited. This progression highlights a key conceptual distinction: the way we define and model accessibility depends fundamentally on how we treat the availability and exclusivity of opportunities and population.

As the link between the introduced constrained measures to widely used methods in the existing literature have already been made (in this dissertation), this future work may underscore the need for better clarity in the framing of assumptions behind accessibility measurement. For instance, by first asking whether populations and opportunities are to be treated as competing and exhaustible. This foundational question could lead to more intuitive and theoretically grounded accessibility frameworks, ones that align methodological choices more explicitly with policy contexts.

A **third** direction involves the development of multimodal accessibility analysis that accounts for the increasingly hybrid nature of urban life. The rise of e-opportunities (i.e., remote work and virtual commerce) and the amount of people engaging with these opportunities has effectively reduced travel impedance to many essential goods and services for those who act on this modality. At the same time, this shift introduces a counter-dynamic: _some_ brick-and-mortar or on-site opportunities may experience a decline in demand as a portion of the population opts for digital alternatives given a constrained and exhaustible number of opportunities. The impact of an 'e-trip' enhances accessibility for some, while reducing opportunities available for others, creating a theoretically complex and evolving urban dynamic that current accessibility measurements often fail to capture.

Cities are becoming increasingly hybrid in how residents access opportunities, and accessibility analysis should evolve to reflect this transformation. While multimodal accessibility remains underdeveloped in the literature, the extension of constrained accessibility methods to multimodal contexts introduced in this dissertation is promising for this use. Constrained multimodal accessibility measures can help identify multimodal accessibility gaps for specific modes, be it car vs. transit as done in this dissertation, or assess the potential losses in on-site accessibility due to the rise of electronic interaction with electronic opportunities. Incorporating these hybrid dynamics into accessibility frameworks could offer a more comprehensive understanding of accessibility and related equitable planning implications in modern urban environments.

And lastly, the **fourth** promising research avenue is tied to work toward the establishment of accessibility thresholds that promote equity and advance mobility justice in our cities. Accessibility in recent decade has been closely linked to discussions of spatial inequalities and social inequities--referring to which groups benefit from, or are disadvantaged by, the distribution of opportunities--and, ultimately, to questions of justice [@soukhovSearchingFairnessStandards2025]. Constrained accessibility measures show particular promise from this perspective due to their interpretability: they represent accessibility in intuitive units of accessible opportunities, which can be meaningfully linked to tangible indicators (such as parkland area supply thresholds as discussed in this dissertation) and other real-world outcomes (e.g., visits to medical appointments) in ways that unconstrained accessibility measures cannot.

Moreover, as constrained measures can be assessed at different spatial and temporal aggregations, they provide a stronger foundation for analyzing disparities across different geographies and timeframes. This makes constrained measures especially suited for use with inequality metrics used in the literature, such as the Gini coefficient or accessibility-based poverty thresholds [@soukhovSearchingFairnessStandards2025]. By combining constrained accessibility measures with methods of inequality analysis, future research can yield richer and more interpretable insights into the distributional effects of urban planning decisions such as transportation investments and policy changes. The use of accessibility methods with different inequality analysis methods offers a path toward more equity-informed and justice-oriented accessibility research--supporting not only descriptive analysis of disparities but also moving towards providing a better quantitative foundation for the creation of assessments of accessibility-related fairness.
